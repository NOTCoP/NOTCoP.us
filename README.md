Communities of Practice versus Communities of Interest[edit]
In addition to the distinction between CoP and other types of organizational groupings found in the workplace, in some cases it is useful to differentiate CoP from Communities of Interest (CoI).
Community of Interest
A group of people interested in sharing information and discussing a particular topic that interests them.
Members are not necessarily experts or practitioners of the topic around which the CoI has formed.
The purpose of the CoI is to provide a place where people who share a common interest can go and exchange information, ask questions, and express their opinions about the topic.
Membership in a CoI is not dependent upon expertise - one only needs to be interested in the subject.
Community of Practice
A CoP, in contrast, is a group of people who are active practitioners.
CoP participation is not appropriate for non-practitioners.
The purpose of a CoP, as discussed above, is to provide a way for practitioners to share tips and best practices, ask questions of their colleagues, and provide support for each other.
Membership is dependent on expertise - one should have at least some recent experience performing in the role or subject area of the CoP.
Example: Someone who is interested in photography and has some background/training in it finds an online CoP for working photojournalists, who use it to discuss various aspects of their work. Since this community is focused on working photojournalists, it would not be appropriate for an amateur photographer to contribute to the CoP discussions there. Depending on the CoPs structure non-CoP members may have access to reading the discussions and accessing other materials of the community.
